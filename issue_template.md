**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Yes. There was an issue the 01-Reshape.R file in your Intro repo.
The issue threw the following error:
Error in FUN(left, right) : non-numeric argument to binary operator

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I corrected the line of code throwing the error. You can upload the revised .R file.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
You can also make the change yourself by removing the line:
> raw <- 1 + raw

**Additional context**
Thanks! :)
